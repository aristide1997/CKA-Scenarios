# Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the "Kubernetes Network Policies Between Namespaces" scenario. You've learned how to create and configure namespaces, deploy pods into these namespaces, implement network policies to control traffic between namespaces, and verify that the policies work as expected.

This skill is essential for managing network traffic in a Kubernetes environment, ensuring that your applications are secure and communicate efficiently.
