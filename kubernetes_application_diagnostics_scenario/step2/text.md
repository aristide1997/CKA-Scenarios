#### Identify Misconfigured Network Policies

1. Verify if the application's pod is isolated by a network policy.
2. Check if the network policy allows traffic to the pod.

<Tips>
- Use `kubectl get networkpolicy` to list network policies.
- Use `kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy_name>` to view policy details.

<Solution>
Adjust the network policy to ensure it allows the necessary traffic to the pod for it to be accessible externally.
